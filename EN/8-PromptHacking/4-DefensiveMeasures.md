# Defensive Measures

Defensive measures protect AI models from prompt attacks. Techniques include input sanitization, model fine-tuning, and prompt engineering. These strategies aim to enhance AI system security, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain ethical output generation.

## Input Sanitization

Input sanitization is a security measure that filters and validates user inputs to prevent malicious attacks. It ensures that the input data is clean, safe, and free from harmful content. By sanitizing inputs, AI models can avoid processing harmful prompts that may lead to undesirable outputs.

## Model Fine-Tuning

Model fine-tuning involves updating the AI model's parameters to improve its performance and security. Fine-tuning can help the model better understand prompts, reduce biases, and enhance its ability to generate accurate and ethical responses. By fine-tuning models regularly, developers can adapt to new threats and improve the model's robustness.
