# Prompt Hacking

Prompt hacking is a form of adversarial prompting where language models are manipulated to generate outputs that violate safety guidelines or are off-topic. Common techniques include manipulating keywords, exploiting grammar and negations, and using leading questions. To combat this, developers implement safety mechanisms such as content filters, continual analysis, and carefully designed prompt templates. As language models become more integrated into digital infrastructure, concerns about prompt injection, data leakage, and potential misuse have grown. In response, evolving defense strategies like prompt shields, enhanced input validation, and fine-tuning for adversarial detection are being developed. Continuous monitoring and improvement of these safety measures are crucial to ensure responsible model behaviour and output alignment with desired guidelines.
