# Citing Sources

As advancements have been made in the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to cite sources — particularly through realtime API access, search-augmented generation and specialized training — significant limitations persist. LLMs continue to struggle with hallucinations, generating inaccurate or fictitious citation. Many LLM lack real-time API access, which hampers their ability to provide up-to-date information or are limited by their knowledge cut off dates. They sometimes cannot independently verify sources or fully grasp the contextual relevance of citations, raising concerns regarding plagiarism and intellectual property. To address these challenges, ongoing efforts focus on improving realtime retrieval (RAG) methods, enhancing training, and integrating human oversight to ensure accuracy in citations.
