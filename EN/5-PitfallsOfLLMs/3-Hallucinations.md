# Hallucinations

Large Language Model (LLM) hallucinations can be broadly categorized into faithfulness and factuality issues. **Faithfulness hallucinations** occur when the modelâ€™s output deviates from provided sources or context, including problems with source-reference divergence, context retrieval, dialogue history misinterpretation, and erroneous summarization. **Factuality hallucinations**, on the other hand, involve the generation of incorrect or unsupported information, encompassing factual inaccuracies, entity errors, overclaims, unverifiable statements, nonsensical responses, contradictions, and fabricated data.

These hallucinations stem from various causes such as training data issues, model limitations, prompt-related problems, and overfitting. To mitigate these challenges, strategies like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), improved training data, rigorous evaluation, clear user communication, advanced prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, output filtering, and multi-model approaches are being employed. As the field progresses, understanding and addressing these hallucination types remains crucial for enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of LLM-generated content.
