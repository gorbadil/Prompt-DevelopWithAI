# Basic LLM Concepts

LLM stands for “Large Language Model.” These are advanced AI systems designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input they receive. These models have been trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform a wide range of language-related tasks, such as answering questions, carrying out conversations, summarizing text, translating languages, and much more.
