# Fix Deformed Generations

Deformed generations in image prompting refer to outputs from generative models that do not meet the intended aesthetic or structural quality, particularly when involving human body parts like hands and feet. This issue can often be mitigated using negative prompts, which instruct the AI to de-emphasize certain undesired features. Key strategies to address this problem include refining prompt design, using negative prompts and weighted terms, selecting appropriate models, implementing iterative processes and feedback loops, keeping models updated, and applying post-processing techniques. While current models may still struggle with certain deformations, employing these strategies effectively can significantly enhance image quality. As generative models continue to evolve, the need for such techniques is expected to decrease, but they remain essential for anyone working with AI-generated imagery to ensure outputs meet desired standards of quality and realism.

## Refining Prompt Design

Refining prompt design is crucial for addressing deformed generations in AI image outputs. By crafting clear, specific, and detailed prompts, users can guide the model to generate images that align with their expectations. Providing descriptive instructions, specifying visual elements, and avoiding ambiguous language can help prevent deformations and inaccuracies in the generated images. Well-crafted prompts enhance the model's understanding of user preferences and improve the quality of the resulting images by reducing the likelihood of misinterpretation or errors.

## Negative Prompts and Weighted Terms

Negative prompts and weighted terms are effective tools for correcting deformed generations in AI image prompting. Negative prompts instruct the model to avoid certain features or characteristics that may lead to deformations. By providing clear guidance on what to exclude, users can prevent unwanted distortions in the generated images. Weighted terms allow users to control the emphasis on specific elements within the prompt, enabling them to fine-tune the model's focus and improve the accuracy of the generated images. By assigning appropriate weights to terms related to human body parts or other critical features, users can guide the model to produce more realistic and visually appealing outputs.
